    <p>Academics have little influence as to whether a person gets a full
      PhD scholarship: it is mostly based on GPA and publication record and
      is done centrally for the entire University.</p>

    <p>It would be useful for me to know more about your background:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Have you published any papers before or wrote any research
        theses (including at undergraduate level)?</li>
      <li>What relevant courses you completed in programming languages,
        compilers, type theory, mathematics, and do you have a transcript
        for that time?</li>
      <li>What relevant industrial experience do you have, especially when
        it comes with novel programming languages and what is your interest
        in the area?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can see my interests by looking at my publications.</p>
